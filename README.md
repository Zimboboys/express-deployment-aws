# Express Deployment AWS 🌧

Automatically deploy an Express app to AWS in a ✨ _serverless-y_ ✨ kinda way
using API Gateway and Lambda. All *you* have to do is configure some workflows
and maybe restructure your code a tiny bit.

## Installing 🔌

If you follow all of the steps below, you should be able to get this up and
running yourself! (_better instructions soon_ 🤞)

1. Create an IAM user with Administrator Access and save these credentials
2. Move `app.listen()` to a "dev-only" process 🧑‍💻
3. Export the Express app module from `backend/server.js`
4. Create a workflow file and set your AWS credentials (_example soon_)
5. Within the workflow, configure the `s3-bucket` and `stack-name` inputs,
and set any env variables that your API needs 🌳

### Inputs
- `s3-bucket` *required* - the name of the s3 bucket that will store the
build artifacts 🪣
- `stack-name` *required* - the name of the Cloud Formation stack name to use
- `domain` - the target domain to deploy the API to. 🚨 *currently untested*

### Outputs
- `api-url` - this is the URL generated by AWS for your API

## Example 🧑‍🎓

A polished example should come soon. This was tested using [this repo](https://github.com/Zimboboys/deployment-practice), which can hopefully help.
